**How to Play Connect Four**

- Normal rules are applied of course

- When the game starts, enter 1 or 2 to play against a bot or play two player

- When playing a round, enter the column number(1-7). The chip will go to the bottom of the selected column that isn't occupied by a chip('_' will indicate the absence of a chip)

- Some tips on how the semi-smart bot works: 
	â€“ the bot chooses a random column(that is not full) if it doesn't find a three in the row to interrupt
        - to check for potential vertical and diagonal connect fours, it looks for any player chips(char 'x') that are three in a row
	- to check for horizontal connect fours it looks checks every group of four positions for 3 of a player's chips
	- it's priorities are columns > rows > diagonals

- Have fun!!
